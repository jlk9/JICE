#= Runs the single column sea ice model and computes the derivatives for all of its fields. The various
    fields of d_jarrays are the partial derivatives of those fields given the gradients for thickness and
    current temperature (ad_h and ad_T).

NOTE:   In cases where there is no snow and empty (thickness 0) snow layers, the partial derivative in terms of
        thickness can be NaN.
